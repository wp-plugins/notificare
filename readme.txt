Get notified on comments and approve or mark as spam with a simple push of a button from your phone.

== Description ==

If, like us, you are always busy, trying hard to keep your inbox empty, you don't want it to be filled up by emails telling you to login to your WordPress blog and moderate comments. The Notificare plugin and its accompanying iPhone/iPad app keeps YOU in control of your comments! Instead of having to login to WordPress, you can immediately approve a comment or mark it as spam with just a push of a button. 

Even better, WordPress is just one of many services that hook into Notificare. The easy to setup and flexible Service Central lets you manage your alerts in one place and get back in control again.
